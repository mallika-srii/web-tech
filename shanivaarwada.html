	<p>Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India.

Built in 1732,[1] it was the great seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818. Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century.[2]

The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site</p>
